Employee Attendance

Database Schema:

We'll have two main tables: Employees and Attendance.

Employees Table:

id: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
name: Name of the employee.
department: Department of the employee.
email: Email address of the employee.
Attendance Table:

id: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer.
employee_id: Foreign key referencing the id column in the Employees table.
date: Date of the attendance record.
status: Attendance status (e.g., "Present", "Absent", "Late").
Here's the SQL to create these tables:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    department VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employees(id)
);
